        <h2 class="page-subtitle">Learn Clean Code Architecture: A Journey Through a Blog App</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
            Welcome to my Blog App, a project I built to dive into the world of full stack web development, specifically focusing on creating 
            scalable, maintainable applications using Node.js. This app serves as a practical learning experience, where I implement clean 
            architecture principles while building both the frontend and backend.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
            At its core, this blog app connects to a custom API I created, which stores all blog posts. The API is accessible through an API key, 
            allowing for seamless interaction between the app and the data. While the interface may seem simple, the architecture behind the scenes 
            is where most of the complexity and learning come into play.

        <h2 class="page-subtitle">Why Clean Architecture?</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
            As I continue to grow in my development journey, I’ve been focusing on understanding the importance of clean code and architecture. Clean 
            architecture refers to a system where the business logic is isolated from external factors, making the code more flexible, scalable, and 
            easier to maintain. It’s a concept often emphasized in building professional-grade software but one that takes time and experience to fully 
            grasp.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
            In this project, my goal was to implement these ideas to see if I could structure the code in a way that allows for scalability without creating 
            unnecessary complexity. It’s been a challenge, especially as I’m new to these practices, but every step has taught me valuable lessons about how 
            to approach software design.

        <h2 class="page-subtitle">Challenges and Growth</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
            Like many developers just starting out, I’ve found that clean code and architecture can be difficult to understand fully when you're working 
            on your own. Concepts like separation of concerns, dependency injection, and the SOLID principles can feel overwhelming. This project is my 
            way of experimenting with these ideas, applying them in a real-world context, and learning through trial and error.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
            While this blog app is only one of many projects I’m working on, it has helped me appreciate the balance between functionality and good code 
            structure. The project is also a testament to my commitment to continuous improvement. By building this app, I’m not just showcasing the result 
            but the process itself—the process of learning how to create scalable applications that can evolve as new features are added.

        <h2 class="page-subtitle">Full Stack Development in Action</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
            The blog app is powered by a Node.js server, where I handle everything from routing and database management to API design. On the frontend, 
            the goal was to keep things simple while ensuring the application interacts smoothly with the backend API. As I expand my knowledge in full 
            stack development, I’m excited about the possibilities of creating more complex applications that can handle larger workloads and more 
            intricate features.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
            This project is just the beginning of my journey toward mastering full stack development. It’s a work in progress, much like my skills, 
            but I’m eager to continue growing and refining my understanding of what it means to write clean, efficient code.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
            Thank you for visiting, and I hope this app provides insight into the work I’m doing as I continue to explore the world of scalable, 
            maintainable software development.
